 *
 * This function assumes that `storage` has already been validated
 * as `globalThis.localStorage` via `assertIsLocalStorage`.
 *
 * It does **not** check for the presence of the storage object itself,
 * only whether core methods like `setItem` and `removeItem` work without errors.
 *
 * @param {*} storage - Expected to be a working `localStorage` object
 * @throws {Error} if runtime access to localStorage fails
